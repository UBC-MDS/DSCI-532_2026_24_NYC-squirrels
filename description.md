NYC Squirrels Dashboard
Our interactive dashboard for exploring squirrel sightings across NYC Central Park. 
Users can filter squirrel observations by age, time of day (AM/PM), and location to visualize patterns.
All this through interactive maps and bar charts showing squirrel activities (running, climbing, foraging) and vocalizations (kuks, quaas, moans). 

The dashboard provides insights into squirrel behavior and distribution in urban ecosystem.
